# Underlying API structure

Once the application is operational, the Swagger documentation will be accessible at `http://0.0.0.0:8001/docs`.

This documentation provides an overview of the system's contracts and APIs. However, it may not be comprehensive and enough for understanding intentions. It is recommended to review this documentation thoroughly to understand the context of these APIs before proceeding.

Assuming the application is currently running at `http://0.0.0.0:8001`, we can move forward with the next steps.
