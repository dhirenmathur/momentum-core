# Hers's what you will need

To get started with our product, you'll need the following:

1. **Docker and Docker Compose**: Ensure that Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. You can download and install them using any of the suggested ways [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. **Git**: You'll need Git to clone our [repository](https://github.com/getmomentum/momentum-core). You can download and install Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3. **Python** (v3 onwards): Momentum is python based so you'll need the support for it running on your system. Usually it's supported by the OS out of the box - but do install if that's not the case.
4. **Portkey** API Key : We use portkey to have capabilities like observability and monitoring for AI Integration with our tool. Sign up for a free account and keep the API Key handy.\

   Once you have these up and running - we can proceed to installation.
