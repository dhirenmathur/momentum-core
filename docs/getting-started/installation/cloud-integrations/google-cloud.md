# Google Cloud

Momentum uses google secret manager to securely manage API keys.\
\
Since you have already created a firebase app, a linked google cloud account will automatically be created. You can use that or create a new one as per your convience. \
\
Use [these](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/secretmanager/latest) steps to setup secret manager, and setup [application default credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc#how-to) for momentum to use in your local system. (Alternative documentation [here](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-api-core/latest/auth.html))\
\
Once that is done - that's all you need to do for google account setup. Only a few more steps before you can get momentum up and running.
