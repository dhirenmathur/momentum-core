# Contributing to momentum

To contribute to momentum :

1. Look at [open issues](https://github.com/getmomentum/momentum-srv/issues) to see if there's something you can do for us.
2. If what you want to do is not part of open issues, create an issue for it.
3. You can start planning and writing code for it.
4. Once the code is ready, raise a pull request towards the main repo for peer review and acceptance.
