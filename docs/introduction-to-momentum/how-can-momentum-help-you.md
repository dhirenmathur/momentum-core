  You should use momentum at every git push to ensure your code is ready for a
  pull request review.

# How can momentum help you?

**Here's what momentum will tell you at every push**

1. Blast radius detection - this will be a list of endpoints that could potentially be affected by the changes you made in your code. This will also be a starting point to decide what parts of your code need to be tested before shipping to production.
2. Visualization&#x20;
3. Behaviour identification
4. Code generation to test functionality&#x20;
5. Debugging (using stack trace)
6. Self-healing (simple cases)

**Coming soon**

1. Debugging (using visualization)
2. Self-healing (complex cases)
3. Test data setup
4. Code fixation
