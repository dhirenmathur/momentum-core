## Why is it Open Source?

Momentum is open source as a way for us to give back to the community. By making the source code available, we empower our users to:

- **View the Source Code:** Understand how Momentum works under the hood.
- **Modify It:** Tailor Momentum to meet their specific needs.
- **Use It Freely:** Integrate Momentum into their projects without restrictions.
- **Contribute:** Improve Momentum by submitting pull requests with their enhancements, benefiting the entire community.

We believe that open collaboration leads to better software and a more vibrant, innovative community. Let's work together to make Momentum the best it can be!
